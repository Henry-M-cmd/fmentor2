This is my second frontend project. 
The challenge was extended by frontend mentors to test my newly acquired html/css skills. 
I did see in practice while trying to make the layout resposive the upside of relative units over absolute ones especially on typograpphy.
Subtle designs like using box shadows can be tricky for a beginner, not because I didn't remember the syntax, but because it's easy to get carried away and overdo it.
